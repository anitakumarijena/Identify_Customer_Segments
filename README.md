### Identify_Customer_Segments
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

## File Descriptions
There is one iPython notebook to showcase work related to this project. The html file was generated from iPython notebook to submit this project.

## Results
Cluster 4 is overrepresented in the customers data compared to general population data. Some characteristics of the group of population that are relative popular with the mail-order company:

in areas where the share of 6-10 family homes is lower (PLZ8_ANTG3=1.73)
in Prosperous or Comfortable households (WEALTH=2.75)
in life stage of Families With School Age Children or Older Families & Mature Couples (LIFE_STAGE=3.30)
Cluster 13 is underrepresented in the customers data. Some characteristics of the segment of the population that are relatively unpopular with the company:

in areas where the share of 6-10 family homes is higher (PLZ8_ANTG3=2.44)
in Less Affluent or Poorer households (WEALTH=4.4)
in life stage of Pre-Family Couples & Singles or Young Couples With Children (LIFE_STAGE=1.98)
